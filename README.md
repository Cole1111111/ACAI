# ACAI | RGB LED Matrix Persistence of Vision Display

Welcome to the RGB LED Matrix Persistence of Vision Display project! This project involves spinning an RGB LED matrix to create a persistence of vision (POV) display.

## Description

This project demonstrates how to use an RGB LED matrix to create a POV display. By spinning the LED matrix at a high speed and controlling the LEDs, you can create the illusion of a stable image in mid-air. The project uses PlatformIO running on an Arduino Uno.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Cole1111111/ACAI.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd ACAI
    ```
3. Install PlatformIO:
    ```sh
    pip install platformio
    ```

## Usage

To run the project on the Arduino Uno, follow these steps:

1. Connect your Arduino Uno to your computer via USB.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino Uno using PlatformIO:
    ```sh
    pio run --target upload
    ```
3. Make sure to follow the hardware setup instructions provided in the documentation.

Using the Visual Studio Code extension for PlatformIO is highly recommended
